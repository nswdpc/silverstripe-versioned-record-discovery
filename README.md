At present, it provides:
1. an "unpublished" modeladmin extension, to provide an additional unpublished view on configured records
1. A report listing unpublished records per model class, based on your selection
1. A "History" tab in configured versioned records, allowing revert via the Versioned extension to a selected version number.
